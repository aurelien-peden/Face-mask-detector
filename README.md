# Description
Proof of concept made during an internship at Paris 12 Val de Marne University.
Developed a proof of concept web app using Flask to localize faces with OpenCV and detect if a person is wearing a face mask in a picture or a video. Used a dataset of +1000 images of people wearing face mask and reached an accuracy of 97% using Transfer Learning with MobileNet-v2 and TensorFlow 2.0/Keras. Project, report and slides used by teachers in classes for next yearâ€™s students.

# Install packages
```
pip3 -r install requirements.txt
```
If it doesn't works, try with Anaconda : https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual
# Try the face mask detection on a picture
```
python face_detector --image ./Examples/<image>
```

# Try the face mask detection on a video or a camera
If no arguments are provided, the detection is done on the camera
```
python face_detector_video [--video./Examples/<video>] 
```

# Start the Flask server
## On Windows
In the flask_serv folder
```
set FLASK_APP=main.py
flask run
```
## On Linux
```
export FLASK_APP=main.py
flask run
```
The trained model has been saved in the face_mask.model file.
